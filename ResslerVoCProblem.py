# Problem. In season 8 of Blacklist, Ressler describes the following as getting 20% closer to finding liz

# They had five suspects for who could be "Rakitin", but before the FBI made a guess as to who Rakitin was, Rakitin had one
# of the five suspects killed. The FBI then made a guess as to who Rakitin was, but Rakitin had another one of the suspects killed.
# So, at the beginning, they had a 20% chance of finding Rakitin. But after the first suspect was killed, they had a 25% chance of finding Rakitin.
# Ressler then says they are 20% closer to finding Rakitin. I think he is wrong.

# He was using variable change to calculate the percentage change, but he should have been using absolute change.
